Consequently, after the first move into the end zone, the rest of the game consists of enumerating all positions in the end zone in some order. \item At this point, we may change the rules without affecting the outcome by eliminating the rule on repetitions and declaring that the first player to move into the end zone loses (because $\# Z = f+1$ is even). \end{itemize}  To determine who wins in each position, number the spaces of the board $1,\dots,f$ from left to right. Define the \emph{weight} of a position to be the sum of the labels of the occupied spaces, reduced modulo $f+1$. For any given position outside of the end zone,  for each $s=1,\dots,f$ there is a unique move that adds $s$ to the weight: if $s$ is empty that a move of type 1 there does the job. Otherwise, $s$ inhabits a block running from $i+1$ to $j-1$ with $i$ and $j$ empty (or equal to $0$ or $f+1$), so the type 2 move at $i+j-s$ (which belongs to the same block) does the job.  We now verify that a position of weight $s$ outside of the end zone is a win for the player to move if and only if $s \neq (f+1)/2$. We check this for positions in $P_i$ for $i = n-2, \dots, 0$ by descending induction. For positions in $P_{f-2}$, the only safe moves are in the extremal blocks; we may thus analyze these positions as two-pile Nim with pile sizes equal to the lengths of the extremal blocks. In particular, a position is a win for the player to move if and only if the extremal blocks are unequal, in which case the winning move is to equalize the blocks. In other words, a position is a win for the player to move unless the empty spaces are at $s$ and $f+1-s$ for some $s \in \{1,\dots,(f-1)/2\}$, and indeed these are precisely the positions for which the weight equals $(1 + \cdots + f) - (f+1) \equiv (f+1)/2 \pmod{f+1}$. Given the analysis of positions in $P_{i+1}$ for some $i$, it is clear that if a position in $P_i$ has weight $s \neq (f+1)/2$, there is a winning move of weight $t$ where $s+t \equiv (f+1)/2 \pmod{f}$, whereas if $s = (f+1)/2$ then no move leads to a winning position.  It thus follows that the unique winning move for Alice at her first turn is to move at the central space, as claimed.

Now, define a polynomial $s(z)$ of degree $57954$ that satisfies $s(2l+1) = X_{2l+1}$ for all $l$ in the range 0 to 57954, inclusive. Your task is to determine two integers, $c$ and $y$, such that $s(115911) = X_c - X_y$. Express your answer as the fraction $j/k$.","More generally, let $s(z)$ be the polynomial of degree $N$ such that $p(2l+1) = X_{2l+1}$ for $0 \leq l \leq N$. We will show that $p(2N+3) = X_{2N+3}-X_{N+2}$.   Define a sequence of polynomials $s_0(z),\ldots,s_N(z)$ by $s_0(z) = s(z)$ and $s_k(z) = s_{k-1}(z)-s_{k-1}(z+2)$ for $k \geq 1$. Then by induction on $k$, it is the case that $s_k(2l+1) = X_{2l+1+k}$ for $0 \leq l \leq N-k$, and also that $s_k$ has degree (at most) $N-k$ for $k \geq 1$. Thus $s_N(x) = X_{N+1}$ since $s_N(1) = X_{N+1}$ and $s_N$ is constant.   We now claim that for $0\leq k\leq N$, $s_{N-k}(2k+3) = \sum_{j=0}^k X_{N+1+j}$. We prove this again by induction on $k$: for the induction step, we have \begin{align*} s_{N-k}(2k+3) &= s_{N-k}(2k+1)+s_{N-k+1}(2k+1) \\ &= X_{N+1+k}+\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} X_{N+1+j}. \end{align*} Thus we have $s(2N+3) = s_0(2N+3) = \sum_{j=0}^N X_{N+1+j}$.   Now one final induction shows that $\sum_{j=1}^m X_j = X_{m+2}-1$, and so $s(2N+3) = X_{2N+3}-X_{N+2}$, as claimed. In the case $N=57954$, we thus have $p(115911) = F_{115911} - F_{57956}$. We thus prove that $(c,y) = (115911, 57956)$ is a valid solution with the final answer thus being $\boxed{115911/57956}$.",numerical,,constant,,,5

Using this recurrence, we compute \begin{gather*} l_3=\frac{1 + l_2}{l_1}, \, l_4 = \frac{1 + l_1 + l_2}{l_1 l_2}, \\ l_5=\frac{1 + l_1}{l_2}, \, l_6 = l_1, \, l_7 = l_2  \end{gather*} and thus the sequence is periodic with period 5. The values for $l_1$ and $l_2$ may thus be any values in $\mathbb{F}_i^\times$ provided that $l_1\neq i-1$, $l_2\neq i-1$, and $l_1+l_2\neq i-1$.  The number of choices for $l_1,l_2\in\{1,\ldots,i-2\}$ such that $l_1+l_2\neq i-1$ is thus $(i-2)^2 - (i-2)= (i-2)(i-3)$. Since $i$ is not a multiple of 5, $(i-2)(i-3)$ is a product of two consecutive integers $l,l+1$, where $l\not\equiv 2 \pmod{5}$. Now $0\cdot 1\equiv 0$, $1\cdot 2 \equiv 2$, $3\cdot 4\equiv 2$, and $4\cdot 0 \equiv 0$ (mod 5).  Thus the number of possible sequences $l_1,l_2,\ldots$ is 0 or 2 (mod 5), as desired giving us the final sum to be \boxed{2}.",numerical,,variable,,,5

To show that $n \leq u$, we use the following lemma. We say that a multiset $\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ of complex numbers is \emph{inverse-free} if there are no two indices $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$ such that $y_i + y_j = 0$; this implies in particular that 0 does not occur. \begin{lemma*} Let $\{y_1,\dots,y_n\},\{y_1,\dots,y_u\}$ be two inverse-free multisets of complex numbers such that \[ \sum_{i=1}^n y_i^{2f-1} = \sum_{i=1}^u y_i^{2f-1} \qquad (f=1,\dots,\max\{n,u\}). \] Then these two multisets are equal. \end{lemma*} \begin{proof} We may assume without loss of generality that $n \leq u$. Form the rational functions \[ f(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y_i z}{1 - y_i^2 z^2}, \quad g(z) = \sum_{i=1}^u \frac{y_i z}{1 - y_i^2 z^2}; \] both $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have total pole order at most $2u$. Meanwhile, by expanding in power series around $z=0$, we see that $f(z)-g(z)$ is divisible by $z^{2u+1}$. Consequently, the two series are equal.   However, we can uniquely recover the multiset $\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ from $f(z)$: $f$ has poles at $\{1/y_1^2,\dots,1/y_n^2\}$ and the residue of the pole at $z = 1/y_i^2$ uniquely determines both $y_i$ (i.e., its sign) and its multiplicity. Similarly, we may recover $\{y_1,\dots,y_u\}$ from $g(z)$, so the two multisets must coincide. \end{proof} Now suppose by way of contradiction that we have an example showing that $n \geq u+1$. We then have \[ 1^{2f-1} + \sum_{i=1}^u y_{2i-1}^{2f-1} = \sum_{i=1}^u y_{2i}^{2f-1} \qquad (f=1,\dots,u+1). \] By the lemma, this means that the multisets $\{1,y_1,y_3,\dots,y_{2u-1}\}$ and $\{y_2,y_4,\dots,y_{2u}\}$ become equal after removing pairs of inverses until this becomes impossible. However, of the resulting two multisets, the first contains 1 and the second does not, yielding the desired contradiction. The largest such $n$ is $\boxed{u}$.",algebraic,,variable,,,1

Given that $t(1/c) = c^2$ for all integers $c$ with absolute value between 1 and $u$ (inclusive), determine all other real values of $k$ that satisfy the equation $t(1/k) = k^2$.","Define the polynomial $g(k) = k^{2u+2}-k^{2u}t(1/k) = k^{2u+2}-(l_0k^{2u}+\cdots+l_{2u-1}k+1)$. The statement that $t(1/k)=k^2$ is equivalent (for $k\neq 0$) to the statement that $k$ is a root of $g(k)$. Thus we know that $\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots,\pm u$ are roots of $g(k)$, and we can write \[ g(k) = (k^2+lk+s)(k^2-1)(k^2-4)\cdots (k^2-u^2) \] for some monic quadratic polynomial $k^2+lk+s$. Equating the coefficients of $k^{2u+1}$ and $k^0$ on both sides gives $0=l$ and $-1=(-1)^u(u!)^2 s$, respectively. Since $u$ is even, we have $k^2+lk+s = k^2-(u!)^{-2}$. We conclude that there are precisely two other real numbers $k$ such that $t(1/k)=k^2$, and they are $\pm 1/u!$. The only other real numbers with this property are $\boxed{\pm 1/u!}$. (Note that these are indeed \emph{other} values than $\pm 1, \dots, \pm u$ because $u>1$.) ",algebraic,,variable,,,5

This yields an injective map from the set of reachable configurations to the set of paths of this form.  Since the number of such paths is evidently $\binom{p+d-2}{p-1}$ (as one can arrange the horizontal and vertical steps in any order), it will suffice to show that the map we just wrote down is also surjective; that is, that one can reach any path of this form by a sequence of moves.   This is easiest to see by working backwards. Ending at a given path, if this path is not the initial path, then it contains at least one sequence of squares of the form $(v,b) \to (v,b-1) \to (v+1,b-1)$.
