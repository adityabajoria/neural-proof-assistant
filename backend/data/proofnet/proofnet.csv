    We need to prove that $-\sup (-A)$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. For brevity, let $\alpha=-\sup (-A)$. We need to show that $\alpha \leq x$ for all $x \in A$ and $\alpha \geq \beta$ if $\beta$ is any lower bound of $A$.



Suppose $x \in A$. Then, $-x \in-A$, and, hence $-x \leq \sup (-A)$. It follows that $x \geq-\sup (-A)$, i.e., $\alpha \leq x$. Thus $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $A$.



Now let $\beta$ be any lower bound of $A$. This means $\beta \leq x$ for all $x$ in $A$. Hence $-x \leq-\beta$ for all $x \in A$, which says $y \leq-\beta$ for all $y \in-A$. This means $-\beta$ is an upper bound of $-A$. Hence $-\beta \geq \sup (-A)$ by definition of sup, i.e., $\beta \leq-\sup (-A)$, and so $-\sup (-A)$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$.

    (a) Let w be any vector satisfying the following two equations:

$$

\begin{aligned}

\mathbf{w} \cdot(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}) &=0, \\

|\mathbf{w}|^2 &=r^2-\frac{d^2}{4} .

\end{aligned}

$$

From linear algebra it is known that all but one of the components of a solution $\mathbf{w}$ of the first equation can be arbitrary. The remaining component is then uniquely determined. Also, if $w$ is any non-zero solution of the first equation, there is a unique positive number $t$ such that $t$ w satisfies both equations. (For example, if $x_1 \neq y_1$, the first equation is satisfied whenever

$$

z_1=\frac{z_2\left(x_2-y_2\right)+\cdots+z_k\left(x_k-y_k\right)}{y_1-x_1} .

$$

If $\left(z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_k\right)$ satisfies this equation, so does $\left(t z_1, t z_2, \ldots, t z_k\right)$ for any real number $t$.) Since at least two of these components can vary independently, we can find a solution with these components having any prescribed ratio. This ratio does not change when we multiply by the positive number $t$ to obtain a solution of both equations. Since there are infinitely many ratios, there are infinitely many distinct solutions. For each such solution $\mathbf{w}$ the vector $\mathbf{z}=$ $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{x}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{y}+\mathrm{w}$ is a solution of the required equation. For

Since $|x-u|<\delta$ implies $a_k<u<b_k$, so that $g(u)=f\left(a_k\right)=f\left(b_k\right)=g(x)$, we again have $|g(x)-g(u)|=0<\varepsilon$. If $a_k<x<b_k$ and $f\left(a_k\right) \neq f\left(b_k\right)$, let $\delta=\min \left(x-a_k, b_k-x, \frac{\left(b_k-a_k\right) \varepsilon}{\left|f\left(b_k\right)-f\left(a_k\right)\right|}\right)$. Then if $|x-u|<\delta$, we again have $a_k<u<b_k$ and so

$$

|g(x)-g(u)|=\frac{|x-u|}{b_k-a_k}\left|f\left(b_k\right)-f\left(a_k\right)\right|<\varepsilon .

iii. If $x \in E$, let $\delta_1$ be such that $|f(u)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ if $u \in E$ and $|x-u|<\delta_1$. (Subcase a).

If $|u-x|<\delta$ and $u \in E$, then $|f(u)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ by definition of $\delta_1$. if $u \notin E$, then, since $x_1, x$, and $x_2$ are all in $E$, it follows that $u \in\left(a_k, b_k\right)$, where $a_k \in E, b_k \in E$, and $\left|a_k-x\right|<\delta$ and $\left|b_k-x\right|<\delta$, so that $\left|f\left(a_k\right)-f(x)\right|<\varepsilon$ and $\left|f\left(b_k\right)-f(x)\right|<\varepsilon$. If $f\left(a_k\right)=f\left(b_k\right)$, then $f(u)=f\left(a_k\right)$ also, and we have $|f(u)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$. If $f\left(a_k\right) \neq f\left(b_k\right)$, then

$$

\begin{aligned}

|f(u)-f(x)| & =\left|f\left(a_k\right)-f(x)+\frac{u-a_k}{b_k-a_k}\left(f\left(b_k\right)-f\left(a_k\right)\right)\right| \\

& <\frac{b_k-u}{b_k-a_k} \varepsilon+\frac{u-a_k}{b_k-a_k} \varepsilon \\

& =\varepsilon

\end{aligned}

$$

(Subcase b). Suppose $x_2$ does not exist, i.e., either $x=a_k$ or $x=a_k$ and $b_k>a_k+\delta_1$. Let us consider the second of these cases and show how to get $|f(u)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ for $x<u<x+\delta$. If $f\left(a_k\right)=f\left(b_k\right)$, let $\delta=\delta_1$. If $u>x$ we have $a_k<u<b_k$ and $f(u)=f\left(a_k\right)=f(x)$. If $f\left(a_k\right) \neq f\left(b_k\right)$, let $\delta=$ $\min \left(\delta_1, \frac{\left(b_k-a_k\right) \varepsilon}{\left|f\left(b_k\right)-f\left(a_k\right)\right|}\right)$. Then, just as in Subcase a, we have $|f(u)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$.

The case when $x=b_k$ for some $k$ and $a_k<x-\delta_1$ is handled in exactly the same way.

"If $f$ is defined on $E$, the graph of $f$ is the set of points $(x, f(x))$, for $x \in E$. In particular, if $E$ is a set of real numbers, and $f$ is real-valued, the graph of $f$ is a subset of the plane. Suppose $E$ is compact, and prove that $f$ is continuous on $E$ if and only if its graph is compact.","\begin{proof}

    Let $Y$ be the co-domain of the function $f$. We invent a new metric space $E \times Y$ as the set of pairs of points $(x, y), x \in E, y \in Y$, with the metric $\rho\left(\left(x_1, y_1\right),\left(x_2, y_2\right)\right)=d_E\left(x_1, x_2\right)+d_Y\left(y_1, y_2\right)$. The function $\varphi(x)=(x, f(x))$ is then a mapping of $E$ into $E \times Y$.



We claim that the mapping $\varphi$ is continuous if $f$ is continuous. Indeed, let $x \in X$ and $\varepsilon>0$ be given. Choose $\eta>0$ so that $d_Y(f(x), f(u))<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ if $d_E(x, y)<\eta$. Then let $\delta=\min \left(\eta, \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)$. It is easy to see that $\rho(\varphi(x), \varphi(u))<\varepsilon$ if $d_E(x, u)<\delta$. Conversely if $\varphi$ is continuous, it is obvious from the inequality $\rho(\varphi(x), \varphi(u)) \geq d_Y(f(x), f(u))$ that $f$ is continuous.



From these facts we deduce immediately that the graph of a continuous function $f$ on a compact set $E$ is compact, being the image of $E$ under the continuous mapping $\varphi$. Conversely, if $f$ is not continuous at some point $x$, there is a sequence of points $x_n$ converging to $x$ such that $f\left(x_n\right)$ does not converge to $f(x)$. If no subsequence of $f\left(x_n\right)$ converges, then the sequence $\left\{\left(x_n, f\left(x_n\right)\right\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\right.$ has no convergent subsequence, and so the graph is not compact. If some subsequence of $f\left(x_n\right)$ converges, say $f\left(x_{n_k}\right) \rightarrow z$, but $z \neq f(x)$, then the graph of $f$ fails to contain the limit point $(x, z)$, and hence is not closed.

To prove this fact, let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. Then, since $g$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\eta>0$ such that $d_Z(g(u), g(v))<\varepsilon$ if $d_Y(u, v)<\eta$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $d_Y(f(x), f(y))<\eta$ if $d_X(x, y)<\delta$

    We shall prove that

$$

f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda) y) \leq \lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda) f(y)

$$

for all ""dyadic rational"" numbers, i.e., all numbers of the form $\lambda=\frac{k}{2^n}$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer not larger than $2^n$. We do this by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ is trivial (since $\lambda=0$ or $\lambda=1$ ). In the case $n=1$ we have $\lambda=0$ or $\lambda=1$ or $\lambda=\frac{1}{2}$. The first two cases are again trivial, and the third is precisely the hypothesis of the theorem. Suppose the result is proved for $n \leq r$, and consider $\lambda=\frac{k}{2^{r+1}}$. If $k$ is even, say $k=2 l$, then $\frac{k}{2^{r+1}}=\frac{l}{2^r}$, and we can appeal to the induction hypothesis. Now suppose $k$ is odd. Then $1 \leq k \leq 2^{r+1}-1$, and so the numbers $l=\frac{k-1}{2}$ and $m=\frac{k+1}{2}$ are integers with $0 \leq l<m \leq 2^r$. We can now write

$$

\lambda=\frac{s+t}{2},

$$

where $s=\frac{k-1}{2^{r+1}}=\frac{l}{2^r}$ and $t=\frac{k+1}{2^{r+1}}=\frac{m}{2^r}$. We then have

$$

\lambda x+(1-\lambda) y=\frac{[s x+(1-s) y]+[t x+(1-t) y]}{2}

$$

Hence by the hypothesis of the theorem and the induction hypothesis we have

$$

\begin{aligned}

f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda) y) & \leq \frac{f(s x+(1-s) y)+f(t x+(1-t) y)}{2} \\

& \leq \frac{s f(x)+(1-s) f(y)+t f(x)+(1-t) f(y)}{2} \\

&=\left(\frac{s+t}{2}\right) f(x)+\left(1-\frac{s+t}{2}\right) f(y) \\

&=\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda) f(y)

\end{aligned}

$$

This completes the induction.

Now for each fixed $x$ and $y$ both sides of the inequality

$$

f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda) y) \leq \lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda) f(y)

$$

are continuous functions of $\lambda$. Hence the set on which this inequality holds (the inverse image of the closed set $[0, \infty)$ under the mapping $\lambda \mapsto \lambda f(x)+(1-$ $\lambda) f(y)-f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda) y))$ is a closed set. Since it contains all the points $\frac{k}{2^n}$, $0 \leq k \leq n, n=1,2, \ldots$, it must contain the closure of this set of points, i.e., it must contain all of $[0,1]$. Thus $f$ is convex.

We know from Theorem $4.17$ that the inverse function $g$ is continuous. (Its restriction to each closed subinterval $[c, d]$ is continuous, and that is sufficient.) Now observe that if $f(x)=y$ and $f(x+h)=y+k$, we have

Prove that $M_{1}^{2} \leq 4 M_{0} M_{2} .$","\begin{proof}

    The inequality is obvious if $M_0=+\infty$ or $M_2=+\infty$, so we shall assume that $M_0$ and $M_2$ are both finite. We need to show that

$$

\left|f^{\prime}(x)\right| \leq 2 \sqrt{M_0 M_2}

$$

for all $x>a$. We note that this is obvious if $M_2=0$, since in that case $f^{\prime}(x)$ is constant, $f(x)$ is a linear function, and the only bounded linear function is a constant, whose derivative is zero. Hence we shall assume from now on that $0<M_2<+\infty$ and $0<M_0<+\infty$.

Following the hint, we need only choose $h=\sqrt{\frac{M_0}{M_2}}$, and we obtain

\left|f^{\prime}(x)\right| \leq 2 \sqrt{M_0 M_2},

which is precisely the desired inequality.

The case of equality follows, since the example proposed satisfies

$$

f(x)=1-\frac{2}{x^2+1}

$$

for $x \geq 0$. We see easily that $|f(x)| \leq 1$ for all $x>-1$. Now $f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{4 x}{\left(x^2+1\right)^2}$ for $x>0$ and $f^{\prime}(x)=4 x$ for $x<0$. It thus follows from Exercise 9 above that $f^{\prime}(0)=0$, and that $f^{\prime}(x)$ is continuous. Likewise $f^{\prime \prime}(x)=4$ for $x<0$ and $f^{\prime \prime}(x)=\frac{4-4 x^2}{\left(x^2+1\right)^3}=-4 \frac{x^2-1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^3}$. This shows that $\left|f^{\prime \prime}(x)\right|<4$ for $x>0$ and also that $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} f^{\prime \prime}(x)=4$. Hence Exercise 9 again implies that $f^{\prime \prime}(x)$ is continuous and $f^{\prime \prime}(0)=4$.



On $n$-dimensional space let $\mathbf{f}(x)=\left(f_1(x), \ldots, f_n(x)\right), M_0=\sup |\mathbf{f}(x)|$, $M_1=\sup \left|\mathbf{f}^{\prime}(x)\right|$, and $M_2=\sup \left|\mathbf{f}^{\prime \prime}(x)\right|$. Just as in the numerical case, there is nothing to prove if $M_2=0$ or $M_0=+\infty$ or $M_2=+\infty$, and so we assume $0<M_0<+\infty$ and $0<M_2<\infty$. Let $a$ be any positive number less than $M_1$, let $x_0$ be such that $\left|\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\right|>a$, and let $\mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\right|} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)$. Consider the real-valued function $\varphi(x)=\mathrm{u} \cdot \mathrm{f}(x)$. Let $N_0, N_1$, and $N_2$ be the suprema of $|\varphi(x)|,\left|\varphi^{\prime}(x)\right|$, and $\left|\varphi^{\prime \prime}(x)\right|$ respectively. By the Schwarz inequality we have (since $|\mathbf{u}|=1) N_0 \leq M_0$ and $N_2 \leq M_2$, while $N_1 \geq \varphi\left(x_0\right)=\left|\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\left(x_0\right)\right|>a$. We therefore have $a^2<4 N_0 N_2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2$. Since $a$ was any positive number less than $M_1$, we have $M_1^2 \leq 4 M_0 M_2$, i.e., the result holds also for vector-valued functions.



Equality can hold on any $R^n$, as we see by taking $\mathbf{f}(x)=(f(x), 0, \ldots, 0)$ or $\mathbf{f}(x)=(f(x), f(x), \ldots, f(x))$, where $f(x)$ is a real-valued function for which equality holds.

Let now $F \subseteq X_\alpha$ be a closed set and $x \in X_\alpha \backslash F$ a point.

Then $\prod_\beta F_\beta$, where $F_\alpha=F$ and $F_\beta=X_\beta$ for $\beta \neq \alpha$, is a closed set in $X$ since $\left(\prod_\beta F_\beta\right)^c=\prod_\beta U_\beta$, where $U_\alpha=F^c$ and $U_\beta=X_\beta$ for $\beta \neq \alpha$, which is an open set because it is a base element for the product topology.

Since all $X_\beta$ are nonempty, there exists a point $\mathbf{x} \in X$ such that $x_\alpha=x$. Then $\mathbf{x} \notin \prod_\beta F_\beta$.

Prove that the intersection of any collection of subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$.,"\begin{proof}

Let $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$ be subspaces of the vector space $V$ over the field $F$. We must show that their intersection $V_1 \cap V_2 \cap \ldots \cap V_n$ is also a subspace of $V$.



To begin, we observe that the additive identity $0$ of $V$ is in $V_1 \cap V_2 \cap \ldots \cap V_n$. This is because $0$ is in each subspace $V_i$, as they are subspaces and hence contain the additive identity.



Next, we show that the intersection of subspaces is closed under addition. Let $u$ and $v$ be vectors in $V_1 \cap V_2 \cap \ldots \cap V_n$. By definition, $u$ and $v$ belong to each of the subspaces $V_i$. Since each $V_i$ is a subspace and therefore closed under addition, it follows that $u+v$ belongs to each $V_i$. Thus, $u+v$ belongs to the intersection $V_1 \cap V_2 \cap \ldots \cap V_n$.



Finally, we show that the intersection of subspaces is closed under scalar multiplication. Let $a$ be a scalar in $F$ and let $v$ be a vector in $V_1 \cap V_2 \cap \ldots \cap V_n$. Since $v$ belongs to each $V_i$, we have $av$ belongs to each $V_i$ as well, as $V_i$ are subspaces and hence closed under scalar multiplication.

    First, let $p$ have $m$ distinct roots. Since $p$ has the degree of $m$, then this could imply that $p$ can be actually written in the form of $p(z)=c\left(z-\lambda_1\right) \ldots\left(z-\lambda_m\right)$, which you have $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m$ being distinct.

To prove that both $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ have no roots in commons, we must now show that $p^{\prime}\left(\lambda_j\right) \neq 0$ for every $j$. So, to do so, just fix $j$. The previous expression for $p$ shows that we can now write $p$ in the form of $p(z)=\left(z-\lambda_j\right) q(z)$, which $q$ is a polynomial such that $q\left(\lambda_j\right) \neq 0$.



When you differentiate both sides of the previous equation, then you would then have $p^{\prime}(z)=(z-$ $\left.\lambda_j\right) q^{\prime}(z)+q(z)$



Therefore: $\left.=p^{\prime}\left(\lambda_j\right)=q \lambda_j\right)$

Equals: $p^{\prime}\left(\lambda_j\right) \neq 0$



Now, to prove the other direction, we would now prove the contrapositive, which means that we will be proving that if $p$ has actually less than $m$ distinct roots, then both $p$ and $p^{\prime}$ have at least one root in common.



Now, for some root of $\lambda$ of $p$, we can write $p$ is in the form of $\left.p(z)=(z-\lambda)^n q(z)\right)$, which is where both $n \geq 2$ and $q$ is a polynomial. When differentiating both sides of the previous equations, we would then have $p^{\prime}(z)=(z-\lambda)^n q^{\prime}(z)+n(z-\lambda)^{n-1} q(z)$.

First, just make the case of where $(v, w)$ is linearly dependent. Then, there does exist $b \in F$ such that $w=b v$. Now, you would have the following: $a_W w=T w=T(b v)=b T v=b\left(a_v v\right)=a_v w$. This is showing that $a_v=a_w$.

Finally, make the consideration to make $(v, w)$ be linearly independent. Now, we would have the following: $\left.a_{(} v+w\right)(v+w)=T(v+w)=T v+T w=a_v v+a_w w$.



That previous equation implies the following: $\left.\left.\left(a_{(} v+w\right)-a_v\right) v+\left(a_{(} v+w\right)-a_w\right) w=0$. Since $(v, w)$ is linearly independent, this would imply that both $\left.a_{(} v+w\right)=a_v$ and $\left.a_{(} v+w\right)=a_w$. Therefore, $a_v=a_w$.

Next, by applying $T$ repeatedly to both sides of the equation above, we get $T^9 e_j=\left(\lambda_j\right)^9 e_j$ and rei =8ej. Thus $T^8 e_j=\left(\lambda_j\right)^8 e_j$, which implies that $\lambda_j$ equals 0 or 1 . In particular, all the eigenvalues of $T$ are real. This would then imply that $T$ is self-adjoint.

Consider a prime $p$ of the form $4 t+3$. Show that $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ iff $-a$ has order $(p-1) / 2$.,"\begin{proof}

    Let $a$ a primitive root modulo $p$.

As $a^{p-1} \equiv 1(\bmod p), p \mid\left(a^{(p-1) / 2}-1\right)\left(a^{(p-1) / 2}+1\right)$, so $p \mid a^{(p-1) / 2}-1$ or $p \mid$ $a^{(p-1) / 2}+1$. As $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p, a^{(p-1) / 2} \not \equiv 1(\bmod p)$, so

$$

a^{(p-1) / 2} \equiv-1 \quad(\bmod p) .

$$

Hence $(-a)^{(p-1) / 2}=(-1)^{2 t+1} a^{(p-1) / 2} \equiv(-1) \times(-1)=1(\bmod p)$.

Suppose that $(-a)^n \equiv 1(\bmod p)$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Then $a^{2 n}=(-a)^{2 n} \equiv 1(\bmod p)$, so $p-1\left|2 n, \frac{p-1}{2}\right| n$.

So $-a$ has order $(p-1) / 2$ modulo $p$.

Conversely, suppose that $-a$ has order $(p-1) / 2=2 t+1$ modulo $p$. Let $2, p_1, \ldots p_k$ the prime factors of $p-1$, where $p_i$ are odd.

$a^{(p-1) / 2}=a^{2 t+1}=-(-a)^{2 t+1}=-(-a)^{(p-1) / 2} \equiv-1$, so $a^{(p-1) / 2} \not \equiv 1(\bmod 2)$.

As $p-1$ is even, $(p-1) / p_i$ is even, so $a^{(p-1) / p_i}=(-a)^{(p-1) / p_i} \not \equiv 1(\bmod p)($ since $-a$ has order $p-1)$.

Let $f(z)=f(x, y)=u(x, y)+i v(x, y)$, where $z=x+i y$.

We first give a mostly correct argument; the reader should pay attention to find the difficulty. Since $|f|=\sqrt{u^2+v^2}$ is constant,

$$

\left\{\begin{array}{l}

0=\frac{\partial\left(u^2+v^2\right)}{\partial x}=2 u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+2 v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} . \\

0=\frac{\partial\left(u^2+v^2\right)}{\partial y}=2 u \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+2 v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} .

$$

Plug in the Cauchy-Riemann equations and we get

$$

\begin{gathered}

u \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=0 \\

-u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0 \\

(1.14) \Rightarrow \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=\frac{v}{u} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}

$$

Plug (1.15) into (1.13) and we get

$$

\frac{u^2+v^2}{u} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0 .

$$

So $u^2+v^2=0$ or $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0$.



If $u^2+v^2=0$, then, since $u, v$ are real, $u=v=0$, and thus $f=0$ which is constant.



Thus we may assume $u^2+v^2$ equals a non-zero constant, and we may divide by it. We multiply both sides by $u$ and find $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0$, then by (1.15), $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=0$, and by Cauchy-Riemann, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=0$.

$$

f^{\prime}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=0 .

$$

Thus $f$ is constant.

Why is the above only mostly a proof? The problem is we have a division by $u$, and need to make sure everything is well-defined. Specifically, we need to know that $u$ is never zero. We do have $f^{\prime}=0$ except at points where $u=0$, but we would need to investigate that a bit more.

Let's return to

$$

\left\{\begin{array}{l}

0=\frac{\partial\left(u^2+v^2\right)}{\partial x}=2 u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+2 v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} . \\

0=\frac{\partial\left(u^2+v^2\right)}{\partial y}=2 u \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+2 v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} .

\end{array}\right.

$$

Plug in the Cauchy-Riemann equations and we get

$$

\begin{array}{r}

u \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=0 \\

-u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0 .

\end{array}

$$

We multiply the first equation $u$ and the second by $v$, and obtain

$$

\begin{aligned}

u^2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+u v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & =0 \\

-u v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v^2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & =0 .

$$

Adding the two yields

$$

u^2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+v^2 \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0,

$$

or equivalently

$$

\left(u^2+v^2\right) \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0 .

$$

We now argue in a similar manner as before, except now we don't have the annoying $u$ in the denominator. If $u^2+v^2=0$ then $u=v=0$, else we can divide by $u^2+v^2$ and find $\partial v / \partial y=0$. Arguing along these lines finishes the proof.

\[

f(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)=|3-z_1-z_2-z_3|^2-|1-z_1z_2z_3|^2.

f(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)&=

&\quad + 2\cos(\alpha + \beta + \gamma) + 2\cos(\alpha - \beta) \\

&\quad + 2\cos(\beta - \gamma) + 2\cos(\gamma - \alpha).

\end{align*}

Since the function $f$ is continuously differentiable, and periodic in each variable, $f$ has a maximum and a minimum and it attains these values only at points where $\nabla f=(0,0,0)$.  A routine calculation now shows that 

\begin{align*}

\frac{\partial f}{\partial \alpha} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \beta} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \gamma} &=

6(\sin(\alpha) +\sin(\beta)+\sin(\gamma)-  \sin(\alpha + \beta + \gamma)) \\

f = |3-2\mathrm{Re}(z_1)-z_3|^2-|1-z_3|^2;

Let $\|\cdot\|$ be any norm on $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ and let $B=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{m}:\|x\| \leq 1\right\}$. Prove that $B$ is compact.,"\begin{proof}

    Let us call $\|\cdot\|_E$ the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^m$. We start by claiming that there exist constants $C_1, C_2>0$ such that

$$

C_1\|x\|_E \leq\|x\| \leq C_2\|x\|_E, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^m .

$$

Assuming (1) to be true, let us finish the problem. First let us show that $B$ is bounded w.r.t. $d_E$, which is how we call the Euclidean distance in $\mathbb{R}^m$. Indeed, given $x \in B,\|x\|_E \leq \frac{1}{C_1}\|x\| \leq \frac{1}{C_1}$. Hence $B \subset\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^m: d_E(x, 0)<\frac{1}{C_1}+1\right\}$, which means $B$ is bounded w.r.t $d_E$.

Now let us show that $B$ is closed w.r.t. $d_E$. Let $x_n \rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d_E$, where $x_n \in B$. Notice that this implies that $x_n \rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d(x, y)=\|x-y\|$, the distance coming from $\|\cdot\|$, since by (1) we have

$$

d\left(x_n, x\right)=\left\|x_n-x\right\| \leq C_2\left\|x_n-x\right\|_E \rightarrow 0 .

$$

Also, notice that

$$

\|x\| \leq\left\|x_n-x\right\|+\left\|x_n\right\| \leq\left\|x_n-x\right\|+1,

$$

hence passing to the limit we obtain that $\|x\| \leq 1$, therefore $x \in B$ and so $B$ is closed w.r.t. $d_E$. Since $B$ is closed and bounded w.r.t. $d_E$, it must be compact. Now we claim that the identity function, $i d:\left(\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\right) \rightarrow\left(\mathbb{R}^m, d\right)$ where $\left(\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\right)$ means we are using the distance $d_E$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\left(\mathbb{R}^m, d\right)$ means we are using the distance $d$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$, is a homeomorphism. This follows by (1), since $i d$ is always a bijection, and it is continuous and its inverse is continuous by (1) (if $x_n \rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d_E$, then $x_n \rightarrow x$ w.r.t. $d$ and vice-versa, by (1)). By a result we saw in class, since $B$ is compact in $\left(\mathbb{R}^m, d_E\right)$ and $i d$ is a homeomorphism, then $i d(B)=B$ is compact w.r.t. $d$.



We are left with proving (1). Notice that it suffices to prove that $C_1 \leq\|x\| \leq$ $C_2, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^m$ with $\|x\|_E=1$. Indeed, if this is true, given $x \in \mathbb{R}^m$, either $\|x\|_E=0$ (which implies $x=0$ and (1) holds in this case), or $x /\|x\|_E=y$ is such that $\|y\|_E=1$, so $C_1 \leq\|y\| \leq C_2$, which implies $C_1\|x\|_E \leq\|x\| \leq C_2\|x\|_E$.

We want to show now that $\|\cdot\|$ is continuous w.r.t. $d_E$, that is, given $\varepsilon>0$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^m$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that if $d_E(x, y)<\delta$, then $\|\mid x\|-\|y\| \|<\varepsilon$.



By the triangle inequality, $\|x\|-\|y\| \leq\|x-y\|$, and $\|y\|-\|x\| \leq\|x-y\|$, therefore

$$

|\|x||-\| y|\|\leq\| x-y \| .

$$

Writing now $x=\sum_{i=1}^m a_i e_i, y=\sum_{i=1}^m b_i e_i$, where $e_i=(0, \ldots, 1,0, \ldots, 0)$ (with 1 in the i-th component), we obtain by the triangle inequality,

$$

\begin{aligned}

\|x-y\| & =\left\|\sum_{i=1}^m\left(a_i-b_i\right) e_i\right\| \leq \sum_{i=1}^m\left|a_i-b_i\left\|\left|\left\|e_i\right\| \leq \max _{i=1, \ldots, m}\left\|e_i\right\| \sum_{i=1}^m\right| a_i-b_i \mid\right.\right. \\

& =\max _{i=1, \ldots, m}\left\|e_i\right\| d_{s u m}(x, y) \leq \max _{i=1, \ldots, m}\left\|e_i\right\| m d_{\max }(x, y) \\

& \leq \max _{i=1, \ldots, m}\left\|e_i\right\| m d_E(x, y) .

\end{aligned}

$$

Let $\delta=\frac{\varepsilon}{m \max _{i=1, \ldots, m}\left\|e_i\right\|}$. Then if $d_E(x, y)<\delta,\|x\|-\|y\|||<\varepsilon$.

Since $\|\cdot\|$ is continuous w.r.t. $d_E$ and $K=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^m:\|x\|_E=1\right\}$ is compact w.r.t. $d_E$, then the function $\|\cdot\|$ achieves a maximum and a minimum value on $K$. Call $C_1=\min _{x \in K}\|x\|, C_2=\max _{x \in K}\|x\|$. Then

$$

    I think this is the proof by contrapositive that you were getting at.

Suppose that $E$ has no limit points at all. Pick an arbitrary point $x \in E$. Then $x$ cannot be a limit point, so there must be some $\delta>0$ such that the ball of radius $\delta$ around $x$ contains no other points of $E$ :

$$

B_\delta(x) \cap E=\{x\}

Call this ""point 1 "". For the next point, take the closest element to $x$ and on its left; that is, choose the point

$$

\max [E \cap(-\infty, x)]

$$

if it exists (that is important - if not, skip to the next step). Note that by the argument above, this supremum, should it exist, cannot equal $x$ and is therefore a new point in $E$.



Call this ""point 2 "". Now take the first point to the right of $x$ for ""point 3 "". Take the first point to the left of point 2 for ""point 4 "". And so on, ad infinitum.



This gives a countable list of unique points; we must show that it exhausts the entire set $E$. Suppose not. Suppose there is some element $a<x$ which is never included in the list (picking $a$ on the negative side of $x$ is arbitrary, and the same argument would work for the second case). Then the element closest and to the right of $a$ in $E$ (which exists, by the no-limit-points argument at the beginning) is also not in the list; if it was, $a$ would have been in one of the next two spots. And same with that point (call it $a_1$ ); there is a closest $a_2>a_1 \in E$ such that $a_2$ is not in the list. Repeating, we generate an infinite monotone-increasing sequence $\left\{a_i\right\}$ of elements in $E$ and not in the list, which is clearly bounded above by $x$. By the Monotone

Convergence Theorem this sequence has a limit. But that means the sequence $\left\{a_i\right\} \subset E$ converges to a limit, and hence $E$ has a limit point, contradicting the assumption. Therefore our list exhausts $E$, and we have enumerated all its elements.

    Suppose $G$ is a group of order 5 which is not abelian. Then there exist two non-identity elements $a, b \in G$ such that $a * b \neq$ $b * a$. Further we see that $G$ must equal $\{e, a, b, a * b, b * a\}$. To see why $a * b$ must be distinct from all the others, not that if $a *$ $b=e$, then $a$ and $b$ are inverses and hence $a * b=b * a$.

Contradiction. If $a * b=a$ (or $=b$ ), then $b=e$ (or $a=e$ ) and $e$ commutes with everything. Contradiction. We know by supposition that $a * b \neq b * a$. Hence all the elements $\{e, a, b, a * b, b * a\}$ are distinct.



Now consider $a^2$. It can't equal $a$ as then $a=e$ and it can't equal $a * b$ or $b * a$ as then $b=a$. Hence either $a^2=e$ or $a^2=b$.

Now consider $a * b * a$. It can't equal $a$ as then $b * a=e$ and hence $a * b=b * a$. Similarly it can't equal $b$. It also can't equal $a * b$ or $b * a$ as then $a=e$. Hence $a * b * a=e$.



So then we additionally see that $a^2 \neq e$ because then $a^2=e=$ $a * b * a$ and consequently $a=b * a$ (and hence $b=e$ ). So $a^2=b$. But then $a * b=a * a^2=a^2 * a=b * a$. Contradiction.

Then there exists an element $y$ in $C(a)$ such that

$$

q=x^{-1} y x

Now,

$$

y \in C(a) \Longrightarrow y a=a y .

$$

Also,

$$

q\left(x^{-1} a x\right)=\left(x^{-1} y x\right)\left(x^{-1} a x\right)=x^{-1}(y a) x=x^{-1}(y a) x=\left(x^{-1} y x\right)\left(x^{-1} a x\right)=\left(x^{-1} y x\right) q .

Therefore,

$$

q\left(x^{-1} a x\right)=\left(x^{-1} y x\right) q

$$

q \in C\left(x^{-1} a x\right) .

If possible, let us assume that

Then

$d$ divides $a$ as well as $a^n-1$.

Now,

$d$ divides $a \Longrightarrow d$ divides $a^n$.

This is an impossibility, since $d$ divides $a^n-1$ by our assumption. Consequently, $d$ divides 1 , which implies $d=1$. Hence we are contradict to the fact that $d>1$. Therefore

"If $G$ is an abelian group and if $G$ has an element of order $m$ and one of order $n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, prove that $G$ has an element of order $mn$.","\begin{proof}

Let $G$ be an abelian group, and let $a$ and $b$ be elements in $G$ of order $m$ and $n$, respectively, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime. We will show that the product $ab$ has order $mn$ in $G$, which will prove that $G$ has an element of order $mn$.



To show that $ab$ has order $mn$, let $k$ be the order of $ab$ in $G$. We have $a^m = e$, $b^n = e$, and $(ab)^k = e$, where $e$ denotes the identity element of $G$. Since $G$ is abelian, we have

$$(ab)^{mn} = a^{mn}b^{mn} = e \cdot e = e.$$

Thus, $k$ is a divisor of $mn$.



Now, observe that $a^k = b^{-k}$. Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $mx + ny = 1$. Taking $kx$ on both sides of the equation, we get $a^{kx} = b^{-kx}$, or equivalently, $(a^k)^x = (b^k)^{-x}$. It follows that $a^{kx} = (a^m)^{xny} = e$, and similarly, $b^{ky} = (b^n)^{mxk} = e$. Therefore, $m$ divides $ky$ and $n$ divides $kx$. Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, it follows that $mn$ divides $k$. Hence, $k = mn$, and $ab$ has order $mn$ in $G$. This completes the proof.

Prove that any two nonabelian groups of order 21 are isomorphic.,"\begin{proof}

    By Cauchy's theorem we have that if $G$ is a group of order 21 then it has an element $a$ of order 3 and an element $b$ of order 7. By exercise 2.5.41 we have that the subgroup generated by $b$ is normal, so there is some $i=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$ such that $a b a^{-1}=b^i$. We know $i \neq$ 0 since that implies $a b=a$ and so that $b=e$, a contradiction, and we know $i \neq 1$ since then $a b=b a$ and this would imply $G$ is abelian, which we are assuming is not the case.

Now, $a$ has order 3 so we must have $b=a^3 b a^{-3}=b^{i^3}$ mod 7 , and so $i$ is restricted by the modular equation $i^3 \equiv 1 \bmod 7$

$$

\begin{aligned}

\phi: G & \rightarrow G^{\prime} \\

since $a$ and $c^{-1}$ have the same order and $b$ and $d$ have the same order this is a well defined function. Since

$\phi$ is actually a homomorphism. For any $c^i d^j \in G^{\prime}$ we have $\phi\left(a^{-i} b^j\right)=c^i d^j$ so $\phi$ is onto and $\phi\left(a^i b^j\right)=c^{-i} d^j=e$ only if $i=j=0$, so $\phi$ is 1-to-l.

Show that any subgroup of order $p^{n-1}$ in a group $G$ of order $p^n$ is normal in $G$.,"\begin{proof}

Proof: First we prove the following lemma.



\textbf{Lemma:} If $G$ is a finite $p$-group with $|G|>1$, then $Z(G)$, the center of $G$, has more than one element; that is, if $|G|=p^k$ with $k\geq 1$, then $|Z(G)|>1$.



\textit{Proof of the lemma:} Consider the class equation

$$

|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum_{a \notin Z(G)}[G: C(a)],

$$

where $C(a)$ denotes the centralizer of $a$ in $G$. If $G=Z(G)$, then the lemma is immediate. Suppose $Z(G)$ is a proper subset of $G$ and consider an element $a\in G$ such that $a\notin Z(G)$. Then $C(a)$ is a proper subgroup of $G$. Since $C(a)$ is a subgroup of a $p$-group, $[G:C(a)]$ is divisible by $p$ for all $a\notin Z(G)$. This implies that $p$ divides $|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum_{a\notin Z(G)} [G:C(a)]$.



Since $p$ also divides $|G|$, it follows that $p$ divides $|Z(G)|$. Hence, $|Z(G)|>1$. $\Box$



This proves our \textbf{lemma}.



We will prove the result by induction on $n$.

If $n=1$, the $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order and hence every subgroup of $G$ is normal in $G$. Thus, the result is true for $n=1$.

Suppose the result is true for all groups of order $p^m$, where $1 \leq m<n$.

Let $H$ be a subgroup of order $p^{n-1}$.

Consider $N(H)=\{g \in H: g H=H g\}$.

If $H \neq N(H)$, then $|N(H)|>p^{n-1}$. Thus, $|N(H)|=p^n$ and $N(H)=G$.

In this case $H$ is normal in $G$.

Let $H=N(H)$. Then $Z(G)$, the center of $G$, is a subset of $H$ and $Z(G) \neq$ $\{e\}$.

By Cauchy's theorem and the above Claim, there exists $a \in Z(G)$ such that $o(a)=p$.

Let $K=\langle a\rangle$, a cyclic group generated by $a$.

Then $K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order $p$. Now, $|H / K|=p^{n-2}$ and $|G / K|=p^{n-1}$.

Thus, by induction hypothesis, $H / K$ is a normal subgroup of $G / K$.

and

$$

(x-y)=(x-y)^3=x^3-x^2 y-x y x-y x^2+x y^2+y x y+y^2 x-y^3

Subtracting the last two relations we have

2(x y-y x)=0 .

We then show that $3\left(x+x^2\right)=0 \forall x$. You get this from

x+x^2=\left(x+x^2\right)^3=x^3+3 x^4+3 x^5+x^6=4\left(x+x^2\right) .

$$

we end-up with $3(x y+y x)=0$. But since $6 x y=0$, we have $3(x y-y x)=0$. Then subtract $2(x y-y x)=0$ to get $x y-y x=0$.

    First we prove for prime $p=3$ and then for all prime $p>3$.

Let us take $p=3$. Then the sum

$$

\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{(p-1)}

$$

becomes

$$

1+\frac{1}{3-1}=1+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{3}{2} .

Therefore in this case $\quad \frac{a}{b}=\frac{3}{2} \quad$ implies $3 \mid a$, i.e. $p \mid a$.

Now for odd prime $p>3$.

Let us consider $f(x)=(x-1)(x-2) \ldots(x-(p-1))$.

Now, by Fermat, we know that the coefficients of $f(x)$ other than the $x^{p-1}$ and $x^0$ are divisible by $p$.

So if,

$$

\begin{array}{r}

f(x)=x^{p-1}+\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} a_i x^i \\

$$

Then $p \mid a_2$, and

$$

f(p) \equiv a_1 p+a_0 \quad\left(\bmod p^3\right)

$$

But we see that

$$

f(x)=(-1)^{p-1} f(p-x) \text { for any } x,

$$

so if $p$ is odd,

$$

f(p)=f(0)=a_0,

$$

So it follows that:

$$

0=f(p)-a_0 \equiv a_1 p \quad\left(\bmod p^3\right)

$$

Therefore,

$$

0 \equiv a_1 \quad\left(\bmod p^2\right) .

$$

Hence,

$$

0 \equiv a_1 \quad(\bmod p) .

Now our sum is just $\frac{a_1}{(p-1) !}=\frac{a}{b}$.

It follows that $p$ divides $a$. This completes the proof.

for some $a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0 \in F$, and that there are $p^n$ choices for these numbers, so that $F[x] /(q(x)) \leq p^n$. In order to show that equality holds, we have to show that each of these choices induces a different element of $F[x] /(q(x))$; in other words, that each different polynomial of degree $n-1$ or lower belongs to a different coset of $(q(x))$ in $F[x]$.



Suppose now, then, that

$$

a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1 x+a_0+(q(x))=b_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+b_1 x+b_0+(q(x))

$$

which is equivalent with $\left(a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\right)^{n-1}+\cdots\left(a_1-b_1\right) x+\left(a_0-b_0\right) \in(q(x))$, which is in turn equivalent with there being a $w(x) \in F[x]$ such that

$$

q(x) w(x)=\left(a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\right)^{n-1}+\cdots\left(a_1-b_1\right) x+\left(a_0-b_0\right) .

$$

Degree of the right hand side is strictly smaller than $n$, while the degree of the left hand side is greater or equal to $n$ except if $w(x)=0$, so that if equality is hold we must have that $w(x)=0$, but then since polynomials are equal iff all of their coefficient are equal we get that $a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}=$ $0, \ldots, a_1-b_1=0, a_0-b_0=0$, i.e.

$$

a_{n-1}=b_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1=b_1, a_0=b_0

$$

which is what we needed to prove.

    Lemma: Let $F$ be a field and $f(x) \in F[x]$. If $c \in F$ and $f(x+c)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$.

Proof of the Lemma: Suppose that $f(x)$ is reducible, i.e., there exist non-constant $g(x), h(x) \in F[x]$ so that

$$

f(x)=g(x) h(x) .

$$

In particular, then we have

$$

f(x+c)=g(x+c) h(x+c) .

$$

Note that $g(x+c)$ and $h(x+c)$ have the same degree at $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ respectively; in particular, they are non-constant polynomials. So our assumption is wrong.

Hence, $f(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$. This proves our Lemma.



Now recall the identity

$$

\frac{x^p-1}{x-1}=x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\ldots \ldots+x^2+x+1 .

$$

We prove that $f(x+1)$ is $\$$ |textbffirreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and then apply the Lemma to conclude that $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x] .3 \$$ Note that

$$

& =\frac{x^p+p x^{p-1}+\ldots+p x}{x} \\

& =x^{p-1}+p x^{p-2}+\ldots .+p .

\end{aligned}

$$

Using that the binomial coefficients occurring above are all divisible by $p$, we have that $f(x+1)$ is irreducible $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ by Eisenstein's criterion applied with prime $p$.

Let $u \in U_i$ but $u \notin \bigcup_{j \neq i} U_j$ and $v \notin U_i$. Then, we have $(v + Fu) \cap U_i = \varnothing$, and $(v + Fu) \cap U_j$ for $j \neq i$ contains at most one vector, since otherwise $U_j$ would contain $u$.



Therefore, we have $|v + Fu| \leq |F| \leq n-1$. However, since $n$ is a finite natural number, this contradicts the fact that the field $F$ is finite.

The statement is clear for $n=0$. We prove the case $n>0$ by induction; the base case $n=1$ is clear. Now suppose $\left(b^{-1} a b\right)^n=b^{-1} a^n b$ for some $n \geq 1$; then

$$

\left(g^{-1} x g\right)^n=g^{-1} x^n g=g^{-1} g=1,

If $H$ is not maximal, then by the previous proof we know there is a maximal subset $K$ containing $H$. Then $K$ must contain a reflection $s r^k$ for $k \in\{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}$.

Lemma: If $D$ is a divisible abelian group, then no proper subgroup of $D$ has finite index.

Proof: We saw previously that no finite group is divisible and that every proper quotient $D / A$ of a divisible group is divisible; thus no proper quotient of a divisible group is finite. Equivalently, $[D: A]$ is not finite.

Because $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q} / \mathbb{Z}$ are divisible, the conclusion follows.

Prove that if $G$ is an abelian simple group then $G \cong Z_{p}$ for some prime $p$ (do not assume $G$ is a finite group).,"\begin{proof}

    Solution: Let $G$ be an abelian simple group.

Suppose $G$ is infinite. If $x \in G$ is a nonidentity element of finite order, then $\langle x\rangle<G$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup, hence $G$ is not simple. If $x \in G$ is an element of infinite order, then $\left\langle x^2\right\rangle$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup, so $G$ is not simple.



Suppose $G$ is finite; say $|G|=n$. If $n$ is composite, say $n=p m$ for some prime $p$ with $m \neq 1$, then by Cauchy's Theorem $G$ contains an element $x$ of order $p$ and $\langle x\rangle$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup. Hence $G$ is not simple. Thus if $G$ is an abelian simple group, then $|G|=p$ is prime. We saw previously that the only such group up to isomorphism is $\mathbb{Z} /(p)$, so that $G \cong \mathbb{Z} /(p)$. Moreover, these groups are indeed simple.

Prove that subgroups of a solvable group are solvable.,"\begin{proof}

    Let $G$ be a solvable group and let $H \leq G$. Since $G$ is solvable, we may find a chain of subgroups

$$

1=G_0 \unlhd G_1 \unlhd G_2 \unlhd \cdots \unlhd G_n=G

$$

so that each quotient $G_{i+1} / G_i$ is abelian. For each $i$, define

$$

H_i=G_i \cap H, \quad 0 \leq i \leq n .

$$

Then $H_i \leq H_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Moreover, if $g \in H_{i+1}$ and $x \in H_i$, then in particular $g \in G_{i+1}$ and $x \in G_i$, so that

$$

g x g^{-1} \in G_i

$$

because $G_i \unlhd G_{i+1}$. But $g$ and $x$ also belong to $H$, so

$$

g x g^{-1} \in H_i,

$$

which shows that $H_i \unlhd H_{i+1}$ for each $i$.

Next, note that

$$

H_i=G_i \cap H=\left(G_i \cap G_{i+1}\right) \cap H=G_i \cap H_{i+1} .

$$

By the Second Isomorphism Theorem, we then have

$$

H_{i+1} / H_i=H_{i+1} /\left(H_{i+1} \cap G_i\right) \cong H_{i+1} G_i / G_i \leq G_{i+1} / G_i .

$$

Since $H_{i+1} / H_i$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the abelian group $G_{i+1} / G_i$, it follows that $H_{i+1} / H_i$ is also abelian. This completes the proof that $H$ is solvable.

Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on the finite set $A$ with $|A|>1$. Show that there is some $\sigma \in G$ such that $\sigma(a) \neq a$ for all $a \in A$.,"\begin{proof}

    Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on the finite set $A,|A|>1$. We want to find an element $\sigma$ which doesn't stabilize anything, that is, we want a $\sigma$ such that

$$

\sigma \notin G_a

$$

for all $a \in A$.

Since the group is transitive, there is always a $g \in G$ such that $b=g \cdot a$. Let us see in what relationship the stabilizers of $a$ and $b$ are. We find

$$

\begin{aligned}

G_b & =\{h \in G \mid h \cdot b=b\} \\

& =\{h \in G \mid h g \cdot a=g \cdot a\} \\

& =\left\{h \in G \mid g^{-1} h g \cdot a=a\right\}

\end{aligned}

$$

Putting $h^{\prime}=g^{-1} h g$, we have $h=g h^{\prime} g^{-1}$ and

$$

\begin{aligned}

G_b & =g\left\{h^{\prime} \in H \mid h^{\prime} \cdot a=a\right\} g^{-1} \\

& =g G_a g^{-1}

\end{aligned}

$$

By the above, the stabilizer subgroup of any element is conjugate to some other stabilizer subgroup. Now, the stabilizer cannot be all of $G$ (else $\{a\}$ would be a orbit). Thus it is a proper subgroup of $G$. By the previous exercise, we have

$$

\bigcup_{a \in A} G_a=\bigcup_{g \in G} g G_a g^{-1} \subset G

$$

(the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup can never be all of $G$ ). This shows there is an element $\sigma$ which is not in any stabilizer of any element of $A$. Then $\sigma(a) \neq a$ for all $a \in A$, as we wanted to show.

    Given that $G$ is a group of order $1575=3^2 .5^2 .7$. Now, Let $n_p$ be the number of Sylow-p subgroups. It is given that Sylow-3 subgroup is normal and hence is unique, so $n_3=1$. First we prove that both Sylow-5 subgroup and Sylow 7-subgroup are normal. Let $P$ be the Sylow3 subgroup. Now, Consider $G / P$, which has order $5^2 .7$. Now, the number of Sylow $-5$ subgroup of $G / P$ is given by $1+5 k$, where $1+5 k \mid 7$. Clearly $k=0$ is the only choice and hence there is a unique Sylow-5 subgroup of $G / P$, and hence normal. In the same way Sylow-7 subgroup of $G / P$ is also unique and hence normal. Consider now the canonical map $\pi: G \rightarrow G / P$. The inverse image of Sylow-5 subgroup of $G / P$ under $\pi$, call it $H$, is a normal subgroup of $G$, and $|H|=3^2 .5^2$. Similarly, the inverse image of Sylow-7 subgroup of $G / P$ under $\pi$ call it $K$ is also normal in $G$ and $|K|=3^2 .7$. Now, consider $H$. Observe first that the number of Sylow-5 subgroup in $H$ is $1+5 k$ such that $1+5 k \mid 9$. Again $k=0$ and hence $H$ has a unique Sylow-5 subgroup, call it $P_1$. But, it is easy to see that $P_1$ is also a Sylow-5 subgroup of $G$, because $\left|P_1\right|=25$. But now any other Sylow 5 subgroup of $G$ is of the form $g P_1 g^{-1}$ for some $g \in G$. But observe that since $P_1 \subset H$ and $H$ is normal in $G$, so $g P_1 g^1 \subset H$, and $g P_1 g^{-1}$ is also Sylow-5 subgroup of $H$. But, then as Sylow-5 subgroup of $H$ is unique we have $g P_1 g^{-1}=P_1$. This shows that Sylow-5 subgroup of $G$ is unique and hence normal in $G$.



Similarly, one can argue the same for $K$ and deduce that Sylow-7 subgroup of $G$ is unique and hence normal. So, the first part of the problem is done.

    $H \unlhd G$ is equivalent to $g^{-1} h g \in H, \forall g \in G, \forall h \in H$. We claim that holds if and only if $h^{-1} g^{-1} h g \in H, \forall g \in G, \forall h \in H$, i.e., $\left\{h^{-1} g^{-1} h g: h \in H, g \in G\right\} \subseteq H$. That holds by the following argument:

If $g^{-1} h g \in H, \forall g \in G, \forall h \in H$, note that $h^{-1} \in H$, so multiplying them, we also obtain an element of $H$.
